## TODO: Come up with header tag line

During my free time I happen to attend a [book club]() and during my working hours I attend a company papers reading group. 
This requires me to do a lot of reading! Which, if you enjoy reading about 
databases or operating system internals this is a *great* way to spend your free time. Recently I got incredibly lucky. The book club and 
my reading group at work are reading the same paper! That means, I get to discuss it with intelligent people--twice! The most recent reading 
was [Global Hash Tables Strike Back! An Analysis of Parallel GROUP BY Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04153). I figured today that I would
discuss a bit about this paper, what makes it interesting to me, and a few ideas surrounding it. 

But first, to better understand the why, we need to look at some foundational ideas.
