# Who am I?

Hey, Hi, Hello. And. Most of all, greetings. I'm Devan Benz. A person on earth and software
engineer.
I have spent most of my life trying to find my place and the wonderful world of technology has really been pretty comfy,
so I decided to stick with it.

# Why am I?

The path one takes is often treacherous and overwhelming. I am writing this blog to push myself, improve my writing
skills, and just leave a trace of myself somewhere on the web. Kind of a
journal to
have a place for spilling out my thoughts, goals, and technical musings. It's overwhelming putting yourself out there
but this is a step in the right direction. *Please* do not take anything and everything I say as matter of fact.
I hold the title software engineer but that does not make me an authority on the subject any more than
anyone else who reads this blog.

# Where am I?

I am based in the Midwestern United States.
